I'm excited to share some recent updates and improvements to the website. Let's go through what's new in this version.
## Website Update v1.2

### Table of Contents Support

One of the major additions is the new table of contents feature, now available on blog posts, privacy policy, and documentation pages. You'll notice a navigation panel on the right side that helps you quickly jump to different sections of the content. This makes it much easier to navigate through longer articles and find exactly what you're looking for.

### Enhanced Home Page Design

The home page has received a visual upgrade! You can now see how the application looks in both light and dark themes, giving visitors a better understanding of the UI's adaptability.

### Documentation Framework

While the documentation section is still in its early stages, all the necessary infrastructure is now in place. We welcome community contributions to help expand our documentation coverage. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to check out our GitHub repository.

### Performance Improvements

Several behind-the-scenes optimizations have been implemented:
- Various style fixes and refinements
- Image optimization using WebP format to reduce initial page load times

As always, I'm committed to improving the website experience. Stay tuned for more updates!
