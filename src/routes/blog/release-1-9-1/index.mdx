The latest version 2.4.30 introduces a revamped "Quick Access" widget, making it easier than ever to keep track of your most frequently used folders. With the ability to pin and unpin items, you'll have quick access to your most important folders. The widget also displays the four most recently opened folders, making it seamless to switch between tasks. And the best part? The widget now syncs with File Explorer, giving you a consistent experience across both apps.
